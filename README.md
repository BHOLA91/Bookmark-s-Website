# 📚 Bookmark Website (HTML Basics)

This repository contains a simple **HTML-based website** showcasing my personal bookmarked links.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- **Heading tags** (`h1`, `h2`, etc.)
- **Ordered lists** (`<ol>`)
- **Unordered lists** (`<ul>`)
- **Anchor tags** (`<a>`) for linking to external websites

## 📄 About the Project
This project represents my early practice in web development. It helped me understand how basic webpage structure works and how to organize content using lists and links.
